First Of all add express to project so that it work as backend 
to our project - npm i express.
- Then we do routing .
- Then we install nodemon as a global package so as our site run side side by without writing command
to not check again and again 
-Then we made statics file like html or css files then we have to mention that file into 
express means at app.js so that expraess get to know about that 
- the static name or the path you are giving in express as path should be same so as to successfully run 
- now our main task is to we made static page as html pages or css pages now create into dynamic pages 
-for increasing code reusability we use template engine and for that we use handle bars i.e the 
express.js view engine for handlebars.js
- for using template engine we use views folder (This name should be as like that only )
- make all your files their only with your name as static files names 
- after that mention into express as e used handle bars other wise it will not reflect on to server 
- we use send in routing to show statics pages so we are using handle bars 
so we have to use render insted of send keyword .
- using partials we can increase the code reusability
- for automatically reflecting changes to our page we have to run command 
as nodemon src/app.js -e js,hbs
